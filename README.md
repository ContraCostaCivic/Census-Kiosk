# Census-Kiosk
Increase participation in the 2020 Census among undercounted communities by helping Contra Costa County develop a multilingual informational kiosk.

One of the changes in the 2020 Census is the ability to fill out the form online. Contra Costa County is hoping to host some Census Action Kiosks which would provide some key facts about the Census as well the links to the Census Survey. Ideally, the kiosk interaction should include the following themes. 1) The Census is Easy to complete 2) The Census is Safe (information will not be shared with any other governmental agency, including ICE), and 3) The Census is Important. The interaction with the user should be engaging and perhaps, even fun (games? Free award at the end like a social media badge?) . Having a Census Action Kiosk design unique to Contra Costa County would help us reach all Contra Costa County residents.
